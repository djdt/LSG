# Lipid Spectrum Generator

## Use:

Currently the software lacks a user interface, and to achieve the desired result the code will need to be modified.

1. Open the definitions file to edit parameters.
	*  Chain_parameters = [Cmin, Cmax, Dmin, Dmax] defines the range of fatty acids to generate, where Cmin and Cmax define the chain length and Dmin and Dmax define desaturation.
	*  Particular classes can be enabled and disabled for spectra generation by modifying the bool associated with the class.
	
2. Spectra will be generated once the 'LipidSpectrumGenerator2' file is executed.

Not all classes are currently functional.
