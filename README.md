# Lipid Spectrum Generator

## How to use:

Currently the software lacks a user interface, and to achieve the desired result the code will need to be modified.

To produce spectra:

Firstly, determine whether positive or negative spectra are desired and modify the dictionary "Charge_Options" to True or False as needed.
Certain lipid species can be generated into both positive or negative spectra. Those which will be generated can be seen via the adducts formed in the "Adduct_Definitions" dictionary.

Secondly, enable those lipid species for which spectra are desired, and disable the others by modifying their respective dictionaries.
Those currently supported are:
Mono-acyl, Di-acyl, and Tri-acyl glycerides 
GPLs: PA, PC, PE, PG, PI and PS.
Whether or not the lipid species generated are allowed to have odd-length acyl chains can be set by modifying the "Odd_Chains" boolean in the "FA_Options" dictionary.
Despite the "Plasmenyl" boolean, Plasmenyl chains are currently unsupported.

Thirdly, by modifying the values:

Cmin (the minimum chain length)
Cmax (the maximum chain length) + 1
Dmin (the minimum level of desaturation)
Dmax (the maximum level of desaturation) + 1

in "def new_spectrum_library():"
the range of lipid species generated generated is limited within those ranges.

After all settings have been modified as desired, the program may be run and the spectra generated by pressing the button.
